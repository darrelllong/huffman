### What is this repository for? ###

* Optimal static Huffman coding of 8-bit symbols. 
* No attempt is made to make the tree externalization
as small as possible since that saves only a few bytes at the cost of increased complexity.
* Makes extensive use of data structure abstraction (as an example to students).
* Works for both Big and Little Endian architectures.
* Version: 1.0
